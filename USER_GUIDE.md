# Welcome to Scope: Your AI Planning Partner

## 1. What is Scope?

Scope is an intelligent application designed to help you break down any goal, idea, or project into a structured, actionable plan. Think of it as your personal team of expert consultants. Whether you want to plan a trip, create a business strategy, develop a recipe, or learn a new topic, Scope helps you transform a simple idea into a detailed, hierarchical to-do list.

The app's motto is: **Scope out. Dive Deep. Complete.**

-   **Scope out**: Start with a high-level goal.
-   **Dive Deep**: Let the AI generate a detailed, nested plan with actionable steps.
-   **Complete**: Use the powerful interface to track progress, add notes, and bring your plan to life.

## 2. Core Concepts: Folders & Scopes

Your work in Scope is organized into two main components:

-   **Folders**: These are your high-level projects or categories. You can create a folder for "Work Projects," "Vacation Plans," or "Personal Goals." All your work is stored within folders, which you can create, rename, and manage in the sidebar. There is a default **Unassigned** folder for scopes that don't belong to a specific project yet.

-   **Scopes**: These are the individual tasks, ideas, or steps within a folder. The key feature of Scope is that scopes can be nested inside each other to create a hierarchy. A simple scope might be "Buy groceries," while a parent scope might be "Plan a dinner party," with sub-scopes for "Send invitations," "Buy groceries," and "Cook the meal."

## 3. How to Generate Your First Plan (The Main Workflow)

This is the central feature of Scope. Turning your idea into a plan is a simple, three-step process:

### Step 1: Choose Your Persona
In the main input area, you'll see a dropdown that says "I want to...". This is the **Persona Selector**. A persona tells the AI *how* to think about your request. Choosing the right persona gives you a much better, more tailored result.

Examples of Personas:
-   **Plan Something**: Creates detailed itineraries, roadmaps, or schedules.
-   **Brainstorm Ideas**: Generates creative concepts and mind maps.
-   **Build a Checklist or SOP**: Creates clear, step-by-step procedures.
-   **Analyze or Calculate**: Handles things like market sizing or financial modeling.
-   **Learn or Explain a Topic**: Breaks down complex subjects into structured lessons.

### Step 2: State Your Goal
In the input field, type what you want to accomplish. Be as simple or as detailed as you like. For example:
-   "A 3-course meal for 6 people"
-   "A 5-day marketing plan for a new app launch"
-   "A workout routine for 3 days a week"

You can also optionally upload an image to give the AI more context (e.g., a picture of a dish you want to make or a broken item you want to fix).

### Step 3: Review and Accept the AI's Plan
After you click the "Add" button, the AI will analyze your request based on the persona you selected. It will then present you with a **Confirmation Dialog** showing a proposed plan.

This is your chance to refine the plan. You can:
-   Review the proposed structure.
-   Provide additional text feedback (e.g., "Make it vegetarian" or "Focus on a low budget").
-   Add another image for more context.

When you're happy with the plan, click **"Accept & Add Scopes."** The AI's plan will be converted into a new, nested scope and added to your currently selected folder.

## 4. Managing Your Scopes: The Different Views

Once you have a plan, Scope provides multiple ways to view and interact with it. You can switch between these views using the tabs at the top of the main content area.

### a. List View
This is your primary, hierarchical to-do list. In this view, you can:
-   **Expand/Collapse Scopes**: Use the arrow icons to see or hide sub-scopes.
-   **Change Status**: Mark scopes as To Do, In Progress, or Done. The status of a parent scope is automatically updated based on its children!
-   **Add Sub-scopes**: Manually add new sub-scopes or use the AI to generate more detail for any existing scope.
-   **Edit & Manage**: Rename, delete, or comment on any scope.
-   **Execute a Scope**: For any scope, click the **Execute** (zap icon) button. The AI will perform a deep-dive case study on that specific task and generate a detailed report, which you can view in the "Execution" tab. This is great for research or generating detailed content for a single step.

### b. Mind Map View
This view provides a visual, branching diagram of your project. It's perfect for:
-   Getting a high-level overview of your plan's structure.
-   Brainstorming and seeing how different pieces connect.
-   Presenting your plan in a more visual format.

### c. Kanban View
This view organizes your scopes into three columns based on their status: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. It's a classic project management tool that helps you visualize workflow and see what needs to be done next.

### d. Execution View
This view is a log of all the **AI Execution Reports** you've generated. Whenever you use the "Execute" function on a scope, the detailed output is saved here for you to review later.

### e. Comments View
This provides a centralized feed of all the comments and replies you and your team have made across all scopes within the selected folder. You can quickly see all the ongoing discussions in one place.

### f. Summary View
For any folder or parent scope, you can ask the AI to generate a high-level progress summary. This is perfect for writing status updates or emails. The Summary View keeps a history of all generated summaries, allowing you to track your project's progress over time.
